<h1>Entertaining Mines</h1>

Welcome to Entertaining Mines!

<h2>Goal of the game</h2>

<p>The board consists of a grid of tiles, with a predetermined amount of mines. Lying under any tile could be a mine, and your goal is to find all the mines.</p>

<h2>Finding the mines</h2>
<p>Every time you click on a tile, as long as the tile doesn't contain a mine, a number will appear in its place.</p>


<center>

<p>The number inside a tile indicates how many mines are neighbouring that tile. For example, in this instance, there is one mine neighbouring this tile, so any one of the marked tiles could contain a mine.</p>

<h2>Game controls</h2>
Entertaining Mines can be controlled with a mouse, a keyboard or a gamepad.

<h3>Using a mouse</h3>
<p>Hover the mouse over a tile, and then perform one of the following actions:</p>
<p>
<b>LEFT CLICK</b> to reveal the number (or mine) under the tile<br />
<b>RIGHT CLICK</b> to flag a tile if you think it contains a mine<br />
<b>MIDDLE CLICK</b> on a already revealed tile to sweep around it. (More on this in the "Sweeping tiles" section)
</p>

<h3>Using a keyboard</h3>
<p>Use the arrow keys to highlight a tile, and then press a key to perform one of the following actions:</p>
<p>
<b>ENTER</b> to reveal the number (or mine) under the tile<br />
<b>SPACE</b> to flag a tile if you think it contains a mine<br />
<b>ENTER</b> on a already revealed tile to sweep around it. (More on this in the "Sweeping tiles" section)
</p>

<h3>Using a gamepad</h3>
<p>Use the left stick or the directional buttons to highlight a tile, and then press a button to perform one of the following actions:</p>
<p>
<img src="qrc:/libentertaining/icons/btnA" height="16"> to reveal the number (or mine) under the tile<br />
<img src="qrc:/libentertaining/icons/btnX" height="16"> to flag a tile if you think it contains a mine<br />
<img src="qrc:/libentertaining/icons/btnA" height="16"> on a already revealed tile to sweep around it. (More on this in the "Sweeping tiles" section)
</p>

<h2>Flagging tiles</h2>
<p>After flagging a tile, a flag will appear in its place. Flag a tile if you think that a mine is situated on that tile.</p>

<table border="white" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: rgb(0, 100, 255); padding: 3px;">
<b>INFORMATION</b><br />
You can't accidentally reveal a tile that you've flagged.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>By default, attempting to flag an already flagged tile will turn it into a marked tile. Marked tiles have a ? on them. You can use marked tiles if you are uncertain of where a mine is and you want to come back to it later.</p>

<h2>Sweeping tiles</h2>
<p>Once a particular tile is satisfied, you are able to sweep it.</p>

<table border="white" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: rgb(0, 100, 255); padding: 3px;">
<b>INFORMATION</b><br />
A satisfied tile has exactly the same number of flags neighbouring it as the number on itself.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Sweeping a tile opens all the neighbouring tiles, except for the flagged ones. This can be faster than manually opening all the neighbouring tiles.</p>

<b>DANGER</b><br />
Be absolutely sure you've put the flags in the right places before you sweep because if any one flag is incorrectly placed, you will uncover a mine and lose the game.
